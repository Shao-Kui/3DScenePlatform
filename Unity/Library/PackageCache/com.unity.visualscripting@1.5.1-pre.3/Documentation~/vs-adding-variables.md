Variables are containers. Each variable has a name, a type, and a value. The value inside a variable can change during runtime.

###The Blackboard window

The blackboard window is opened via the blackboard (**<>**) button in the Script Graph window. It contains one tab per kind of variable. The graph tab is only enabled if a script graph is selected. The object tab is only enabled if a game object is selected.
