#Creating a state unit

State Units are similar to [super units](vs-super-units.md), however for state graphs rather than for script graphs; you can nest a whole state graph into a single unit in a parent script graph.

To create a state unit:

1. Do one of the following:
   - Select **Nesting** **&gt; State Unit** in the fuzzy finder.
     **Double-click** the node or use the Edit Graph button from its inspector to open the nested graph. 
   - From a graph:
     - Drag and drop the graph asset into your graph, or
     - Select it from the Graphs category in the fuzzy finder.
