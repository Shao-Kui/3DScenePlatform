Groups are boxes that you create in the graph that to help you organize your graph and aid in reusability of parts of the visual scripts.

To create a group in a script graph:

1. Select an area on the graph while holding the **Ctrl key**, or **Cmd** on Mac.
2. Drag across the graph to include the units that are part of the group.
3. Give each group a title.
   Tip: It is recommended to provide groups with meaningful titles.

Note: Select all items in a group by double-clicking the group's header.

Note: When using the Unity control scheme, move the group without moving its contents by holding the Alt (Option) key and dragging its header.

Right-click on a group and select **Delete** (**Section**) to delete the group.

Use the graph inspector to provide a comment and a custom color to your group. The comment is only visible in the inspector.
