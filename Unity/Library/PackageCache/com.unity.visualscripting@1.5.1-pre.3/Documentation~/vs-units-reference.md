Units are the most basic element of computation in visual scripting. Units display the required information as text, but editing is done via the Inspector. To edit them, select any unit and edit its properties in the Inspector.

###This unit

The [This](vs-self.md) unit returns the game object that owns the machine in which the graph runs.

###Control units

[Control](vs-control.md) units branch, loop and merge the flow.

###Time  units

[Time](vs-time.md) units include timer, cooldown and wait units.

###Events

Scripting units listen for [events](vs-events-reference.md). They are the starting point for all scripts and appear as special green units in graphs.

###Variables

These units get, set, and check [variables](vs-variables-reference.md).

###Nulls

Units that deal with the [nulls](vs-nulls.md), a.k.a. "nothing" value.

###Formulas

[Formula](vs-formula.md) evaluates logical and mathematical expressions directly via a textual Formula and match with multiple arguments.
