#Configuring visual scripting

|**Note** |
|:---|
|For versions 2019/2020 LTS, download the visual scripting solution from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-bolt-163802).|

Visual scripting has two configuration options available. Access them both through **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Visual Scripting**;

 * Type Options: choose the type for variables and units. MonoBehaviour types are always included.
 * Node Library: the assemblies that you want to use to look for units. By default, all projects and Unity assemblies are included. Use the **Add (+)** to add new assemblies.

Each option has a tooltip explaining what it does. If you're not sure what an option does, you can leave it to its default value and change it at a later date.

Note: Some options may require a restart. This may not always be indicated. If you find that your configuration change hasn't been applied, try restarting the editor.
