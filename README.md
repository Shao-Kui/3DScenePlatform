# Introduction
This is the repository of the paper ``Geometry-Based Layout Generation with Hyper-Relations AMONG Objects". Our platform is web-based. 

We assume developers and researchers would first deploy this platform. The [manuals](#Manuals) are available in the latter of this doc if you wish to directly use a ready clone. 

# Requirements
Requirements are mainly for running the back-end including the algorithm. Dependencies at front-end are already included, but Chrome is still recommended. The server is easily run by
"python main.py", if the following requirements are satisfied: 

numpy

PyTorch

# Datasets
This section discuss how we organize datasets.

Note that we have no copyright to distribute datasets, especially SUNCG. 3D-Front is available, please refer to their [website][3dfront] for downloading.
